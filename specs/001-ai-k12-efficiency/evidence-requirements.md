# Evidence Requirements (APA 7th Edition) for AI/K12 Efficiency Paper

## 1. General Principles

*   **Evidence-Based Analysis:** All claims, assertions, and arguments made in the paper must be supported by credible, verifiable evidence. Avoid speculative statements or unsubstantiated opinions.
*   **Credible Sources:** Prioritize peer-reviewed academic journals, reputable books, scholarly articles, official reports from educational or governmental organizations (e.g., UNESCO, OECD, national education departments), and well-regarded industry research. Avoid blogs, opinion pieces, or non-academic websites unless used as primary data sources (e.g., specific educational program websites, which should still be critically evaluated).
*   **Recency:** Focus on recent literature, particularly from the last decade (2015-2025), to ensure the information reflects current AI technologies and pedagogical approaches.
*   **Balance:** Present a balanced view of evidence, including findings that may challenge or qualify the primary arguments, to demonstrate thoroughness and objectivity.

## 2. In-Text Citations

*   **Author-Date System:** Use the APA author-date citation system for all in-text references.
    *   **Narrative Citation:** Author's last name and year of publication appear in the sentence (e.g., "Smith (2020) found that...").
    *   **Parenthetical Citation:** Author's last name and year of publication appear in parentheses (e.g., "...as shown in recent studies (Smith, 2020)").
*   **Direct Quotations:** For direct quotations, include the page number or paragraph number (for sources without page numbers).
    *   Example: "(Smith, 2020, p. 45)" or "(Jones, 2019, para. 3)".
*   **Multiple Authors:**
    *   Two authors: Cite both names (e.g., Smith & Johnson, 2021).
    *   Three or more authors: Cite the first author's name followed by "et al." (e.g., Chen et al., 2020).
*   **No Author:** Use the title of the work (or a shortened version) and the year.
*   **No Date:** Use "n.d." for "no date" (e.g., Smith, n.d.).
*   **Secondary Sources:** If citing a source that was cited in another source, use "as cited in" (e.g., Johnson, as cited in Smith, 2020). Whenever possible, retrieve and cite the original source.

## 3. References List

*   **Alphabetical Order:** The references list at the end of the paper must be organized alphabetically by the last name of the first author of each work.
*   **Hanging Indent:** Each entry should have a hanging indent (the first line of each reference is flush with the left margin, and subsequent lines are indented).
*   **Required Information (Common Source Types):**
    *   **Journal Article:** Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of article. *Title of Periodical, volume*(issue), pages. DOI (if available)
    *   **Book:** Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of work*. Publisher.
    *   **Chapter in an Edited Book:** Author, A. A. (Year). Title of chapter. In E. E. Editor & F. F. Editor (Eds.), *Title of book* (pp. pages). Publisher.
    *   **Website/Webpage:** Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). *Title of work*. Site name. URL
    *   **Report:** Author, A. A. (Year). *Title of report* (Report No. xxx). Publisher. URL (if applicable)
*   **Consistency:** Ensure absolute consistency in formatting across all references.
*   **DOIs/URLs:** Include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for journal articles when available. Include stable URLs for online sources.

## 4. Specific Content-Related Evidence Needs

*   **Quantitative Data:** When discussing efficiency gains, teacher workload reduction, or student outcome improvements, quantify impacts with percentages, averages, or statistical findings from the literature. Always cite the source of these figures.
*   **Case Studies:** For each case study, provide clear references to the institutions, programs, or studies from which the information is drawn.
*   **Diagrams/Frameworks:** Any conceptual frameworks, diagrams, or models presented must be either original to the paper or properly cited if adapted from existing work.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** When discussing risks or limitations, provide citations to studies or reports that highlight these challenges in educational AI.

## 5. Review Process

*   **Cross-Referencing:** Ensure that every in-text citation has a corresponding entry in the references list, and vice-versa.
*   **Accuracy Check:** Verify that author names, years, titles, and other bibliographic details are accurate against the original sources.
*   **Style Guide Adherence:** Conduct a final pass to confirm strict adherence to all APA 7th edition formatting rules.
